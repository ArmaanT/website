Hi, I'm Armaan Tobaccowalla. Iâ€™m a Dual-Degree student at the University of Pennsylvania studying computer science and finance. My hobbies include programming, swimming, and listening to music. I'm interested in the intersection of technology and business and love to apply technology in new ways.
