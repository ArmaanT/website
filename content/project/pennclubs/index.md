Penn Clubs is Penn Labs product to democratize information about clubs. It uses [Penn Labs accounts](/project/django-labs-accounts) to allow students at Penn to easily find information about clubs, their events, and applications. Penn Clubs also allows students to add themselves to clubs' mailing lists and join clubs as members. It is built using a Django backend and a React frontend.
