As part of the [New Jersey Governor's School in the Sciences](http://www.drew.edu/governors-school/), I helped design and build a speaker recognition utility that could identify the speaker of a specific keyword from a closed set of individuals. The program used machine learning and was 100% accurate in identifying individuals.
