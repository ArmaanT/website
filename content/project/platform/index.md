Platform is a backend API for all of Penn Labs' products. It is the brains of Penn Labs' account system which allows users to login through the University of Pennsylvania's SSO provider ([Shibboleth](https://www.shibboleth.net/)). Platform also provides information to dynamically render our [website](https://pennlabs.org/).
